# AI-based Triaging for Consultations in Emergency Care (A&E)
jsw66 IIB project

This repository contains the code run for my IIB project. The pipelines were found on https://huggingface.co and can be found referenced in the files.

There are 3 folders, one for each model. Inside each folder are variants of files that were run in order to obtain slightly different outputs. The single files were formatted to run the model on one input sequence. The bulk files were configured to run on a large input list of all the patient responses.

Patient data is not in this repository as an NDA was signed not to distribute this information.
