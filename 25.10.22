Investigating NLP models for sentiment analysis in order to interpret text box inputs from ED patients.
-graded SA
-emotional detection
-aspect based SA: finding the sentiment attributed to a specific thing in the statement

The ideal model would be a mix of emotion/aspect based SA. E.g. "my arm really hurts". We can extract the emotion of the statment which is moderate pain. We can also extract the cause/location of the pain - the arm.

Model input:
"My arm really hurts"

Model output:
BODY PART: arm
SEVERITY: moderate pain
SCORE: 7 (maybe a relative score rating, relative to other patients also waiting to be seen)

Other thought - what happens with 'slang' input, e.g. really -> rly

Work to do:
- continue reading on implementation of SA / NLP
- train a basic model to output the sentiment of a basic input sentence
